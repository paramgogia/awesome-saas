## 📌 How to Contribute

Here’s how you can get started:

1. Find an issue and add a comment to the issue, and let us know what you are working on.
2. **Fork/clone** the main repository.  
3. Inside the `agents/` folder, **create a new folder** with a descriptive name for your agent.  
4. Add:
   - Your **agent code**  
   - A **README.md** explaining what it does, how to run it, and any dependencies  
   - Any required config files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`)  
5. Commit your changes and **open a Pull Request (PR)**.  

That’s it! Once reviewed, your contribution will be merged and showcased.

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your agent actually aligns with the themes (templates, agents, memory, etc.).  
- Use a descriptive README inside your agent folder so people know what it does.  
- Keep your implementation clean and organized (no unnecessary files).  
- Make sure your repo doesn’t violate licensing or content rules.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If your PR isn’t getting merged:  

- ✅ Check that your folder is inside `agents/`  
- ✅ Make sure your agent has a README  
- ✅ Confirm that the code runs without obvious errors  
- ✅ If still stuck, [**raise an issue**](https://github.com/Alchemyst-ai/awesome-saas/issues/new)
