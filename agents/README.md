# 🧑‍💻 Agents

Welcome to the **Agents** folder!  
This is where all community-contributed AI agents live. Each sub-folder here contains an agent built using the **Alchemyst AI Platform** — whether it’s a CLI agent, SaaS prototype, or something experimental with Memory AI.

---

## 📂 Structure

Each agent should live inside its own folder under `agents/`.  
For example:

agents/
├── email-agent/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── main.py
│ ├── requirements.txt
│ └── ...
├── chatbot-agent/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── app.js
│ └── ...
└── ...

## 📌 How to Add Your Agent

1. **Fork/clone** the main repository.  
2. Inside the `agents/` folder, **create a new folder** with a descriptive name for your agent.  
3. Add:
   - Your **agent code**  
   - A **README.md** explaining what it does, how to run it, and any dependencies  
   - Any required config files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`)  
4. Commit your changes and **open a Pull Request (PR)**.  

---

## ✅ Guidelines

- Keep your agent **self-contained** (dependencies in its own folder).  
- Always include a **README.md** with:  
  - What the agent does  
  - Setup instructions  
  - Example usage  
- Stay aligned with the repo’s theme (AI Agents, AI SaaS, Agentic AI, Memory AI).  
- No irrelevant or broken code.

## 🛠 Examples

- `cli-context-agent` → A simple CLI-based AI agent with context memory.  
- `support-bot` → Customer support agent with knowledge base lookup.  
- `saas-template` → Starter SaaS app using Alchemyst AI platform.
